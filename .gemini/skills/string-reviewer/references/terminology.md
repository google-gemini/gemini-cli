### Preferred

- Use **"create"** when a user is creating or setting up something.
- Use **"allow"** instead of **"may"** to indicate that permission has been granted 
  to perform some action.
- Use **"canceled"**, not **"cancelled"**.
- Use **"configure"** to refer to the process of changing the attributes of a 
  feature, even if that includes turning on or off the feature.
- Use **"delete"**   when the action being performed is destructive.
- Use **"enable"** for binary operations that turn a feature or API on. Use "turn 
  on" and "turn off" instead of "enable" and "disable" for other situations.
- Use **"key combination"** to refer to pressing multiple keys simultaneously.
- Use **"key sequence"** to refer to pressing multiple keys separately in order.
- Use **"modify"** to refer to something that has changed vs obtaining the
  latest version of something.
- Use **"remove"** when the action being performed takes an item out of a larger
  whole, but doesn't destroy the item itself.
- Use **"set up"** as a verb. Use **"setup"** as a noun or adjective.
- Use **"show"**. In general, use paired with **"hide"**.
- Use **"sign in"**, **"sign out"** as a verb. Use **"sign-in"** or 
  **"sign-out"** as a noun or adjective.
- Use **"update"** when you mean to obtain the latest version of something.
- Use **"want"** instead of **"like"** or **"would like"**.

#### Don't use

- Don't use **"etc."** It's redundant. To convey that a series is incomplete,
  introduce it with "such as" instead.
- Don't use **"hostname"**, use "host name" instead.
- Don't use **"in order to"**. It's too formal. "Before you can" is usually better 
  in UI text.
- Don't use **"one or more"**. Specify the quantity where possible. Use "at
  least one" when the quantity is 1+ but you can't be sure of the number.
  Likewise, use "at least one" when the user must choose a quantity of 1+.
- Don't use the terms **"log in"**, **"log on"**, **"login"**, **"logout"** or
  **"log out"**.
- Don't use **"like"** or **"would you like"**. Use **"want"** instead. Better yet, 
  rephrase so that it's not referring to the user's emotional state, but rather
  what is required.

#### Use with caution

- Avoid using **"leverage"**, especially as a verb. "Leverage" is considered a 
  buzzword largely devoid of meaning apart from the simpler "use".
- Avoid using **"once"** as a synonym for "after". Typically, when "once" is used 
  in this way, it is followed by a verb in the perfect tense. 
- Don't use **"e.g."** Use "example", "such as", "like", or "for example". The
  phrase is always followed by a comma.
- Don't use **"i.e."** unless absolutely essential to make text fit. 
  Use "that is" instead.
- Use **"disable"** for binary operations that turn a feature or API off. Use 
  "turn on" and "turn off" instead of "enable" and "disable" for other 
  situations. For UI elements that are not available, use "dimmed" instead
  of "disabled".
- Use **"please"** only when you're asking the user to do something
  inconvenient, not just following the instructions in a typical flow.
- Use **"really"** sparingly in such constructions as "Do you really want to..." 
  Because of the weight it puts on the decision, it should be used to confirm 
  actions that the user is extremely unlikely to make.
