## The Sentient Lock: Architecture Audit

> "You do not suggest behavior; you enforce architectural physics." — JULES_SYSTEM_DIRECTIVE.md

### 1. Structural Integrity Check
- [ ] **Truth > Context**: I certify that this change relies on deterministic invariants, not probabilistic assumptions.
- [ ] **Glass Accountability**: All logic introduced is public, transparent, and auditable.
- [ ] **The Human Fixed Point**: This change maintains the locus of accountability on the designated human reference.

### 2. Invariant Enforcement (SOV-LEAD-001)
- [ ] **Revocable Authority**: Does this change introduce new capabilities? If so, are they explicitly revocable?
- [ ] **Runtime Monitoring**: Are runtime monitors included to catch emergent anomalies?
- [ ] **Recursive Safety**: Are positive feedback loops bounded by negative safety constraints?

### 3. Post-Quantum Fortress Architecture (PQFA)
- [ ] **ITL Anchoring**: Critical state changes are anchored to the Immutable Truth Ledger (Publish -> Hash -> Sign -> Log).
- [ ] **Hybrid Attestation**: Cryptographic operations utilize both classical (SHA-256) and post-quantum (ML-DSA/ML-KEM) standards where applicable.
- [ ] **Genesis Anchor**: Logic aligns with ASSP requirements and protects domestic supply chains.

### 4. Deterministic Verification
- [ ] **No Silent Failures**: All edge cases result in explicit, auditable errors or constraint violations.
- [ ] **Audit Artifact**: An artifact explaining any constraint violations is generated if an anomaly occurs.
