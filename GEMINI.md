## Building and running

Every time we make a set of changes you should run the following commands:

Build the repo:
npm run build

Run tests:
npm run test

Type Check:
npm run typecheck

Lint and final checks:
npm run preflight

## Writing Tests

When writing tests look at existing tests in packages/server and packages/cli to conform with the conventions in those files.

## Git Repo

The main branch for this project is called "main"

## React

Write idiomatic React code avoiding using useEffect and useRef when possible.

## Comments policy

Only write high-value comments if at all. Avoid talking to the user through comments.
