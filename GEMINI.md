### ‚ùó A Wizard's Cautionary Notes

*   **Context is Key:** The wisdom within this scroll is based on the state of the art as of **July 2, 2025**. The digital ether is ever-changing.
*   **Limitations of Power:** Some enchantments, like cached token stats, require the use of an API key. Others, like image generation, are summoned through MCP servers.
*   **Respect the Flow:** The free tier of Gemini 2.5 Pro allows for 60 requests per minute and 1000 per day. Should you require more, you must seek a key of greater power from Google AI Studio or Vertex AI.
