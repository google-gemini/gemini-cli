## Gemini CLI: Built-in Tools Overview

The Gemini CLI provides a suite of built-in tools designed to enhance productivity, streamline development workflows, and extend the capabilities of the Gemini AI agent directly in your terminal. Below is a summary of the main tools and features available in the Gemini CLI:

### Core Tools and Commands

- **File Operations**
    - **ReadFile**: Read the contents of a file.
    - **WriteFile**: Write content to a file.
    - **Edit**: Edit files using natural language instructions.
    - **FindFiles**: Search for files matching a pattern.
    - **ReadFolder**: List or read contents of a folder.
    - **ReadManyFiles**: Read multiple files at once.
- **Terminal \& Shell Integration**
    - **Shell**: Run shell commands directly from the CLI.
    - **Terminal**: Interact with the terminal environment via the agent.
- **Memory and State**
    - **SaveMemory**: Store information in the agent's memory for later use.
    - **/memory**: Command to access or manipulate the agent's memory.
- **Search \& Web Integration**
    - **GoogleSearch or Search**: Perform real-time web searches to ground responses with up-to-date information.
    - **WebFetch**: Fetch and process web content for use in prompts or workflows.
- **Statistics and Agent Management**
    - **/stats**: Show usage statistics and quotas.
    - **/tools**: List all available tools and their descriptions.
    - **/mcp**: Manage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and integrations.


### Advanced Features

- **Yolo Mode**: Enables the agent to run commands autonomously for complex tasks.
- **Custom Extensions**: Support for user-defined tools and extensions via the MCP protocol, allowing integration with external services (e.g., JIRA, custom test libraries).
- **Code Understanding \& Test Generation**
    - Explain code, generate summaries, and create tests (e.g., pytest cases) using natural language.
- **Documentation Support**
    - Generate structured markdown documentation, changelogs, and GitHub issue replies.


### Example Use Cases

- Navigating and understanding large codebases.
- Detecting and fixing bugs.
- Generating and editing code.
- Running build, test, or git commands.
- Fetching real-time web information for research or validation.
- Automating repetitive development tasks.


### Extensibility

Gemini CLI is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add or disable tools as needed and to personalize their workflow through configuration files and custom tool integrations[^1][^2][^3][^4].
