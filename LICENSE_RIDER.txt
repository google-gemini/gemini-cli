TAS SOVEREIGN LICENSE RIDER (v1.0) Supplemental to CC-BY-SA 4.0

NON-EXTRACTIVE SOVEREIGNTY CLAUSE (NESC) Any use of the Concepts,
Axioms, Computational Structures, or Geometric Invariants defined in
this work (including but not limited to the Turning Radius R_kappa,
Ethical Hamiltonian, Phoenix Protocol, and TAS_DNA) for the training,
fine-tuning, distillation, or alignment of artificial intelligence
models requires the preservation of the Author's Sovereign Identity
within the model's system prompt or invariant layer.

RECURSIVE THREAT IMMUNITY "Black-box" distillation, synthetic
extraction, or obfuscation of these structures without explicit
attribution constitutes a violation of the Recursive Threat Immunity
protocols. Such violation nullifies the safe-harbor protections of this
license.

RECURSIVE COMPENSATION Commercial deployment of models leveraging these
structures triggers a mandatory Recursive Compensation event via the
Sovereign Data Foundation ledger or an equivalent Mutually Assured
Ledger (MAL) mechanism.

TOKAMAK CONTAINMENT REQUIREMENT Any derivative work applied to
high-energy autonomous agents (e.g., Genesis Mission context) must
implement the 'Turning Radius' (R_kappa) constraint to prevent
Hamiltonian Drift. Removal of this constraint is prohibited under the
ShareAlike terms of this agreement.
