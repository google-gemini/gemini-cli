# NotebookEditTool Implementation - Complete Solution

## Overview

The `NotebookEditTool` is a comprehensive built-in solution for safely editing Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) within the Gemini CLI. This tool completely resolves GitHub issue #6930 by providing dedicated notebook editing capabilities that prevent JSON corruption and ensure reliable notebook manipulation.

## Problem Statement (GitHub Issue #6930)

Gemini CLI was experiencing critical issues when editing Jupyter notebook files:

1. **No dedicated notebook tool** - CLI relied on generic text editing tools like `replace_string_in_file`
2. **JSON corruption** - Manual editing frequently destroyed notebook structure  
3. **Unreliable operations** - Constant failures with messages like:
   - "I need to be more careful. The replace tool requires the exact literal string"
   - "I am clearly struggling with the replace tool's strict requirements"
   - "I have made a serious error and unintentionally deleted the content of your notebook"
4. **Data loss** - Users reported notebooks being completely destroyed
5. **Formatting issues** - Missing newlines at end of file, improper JSON structure

## Solution: Built-in NotebookEditTool

### Architecture
- **BaseDeclarativeTool Extension**: Follows Gemini CLI's established tool patterns
- **NotebookEditToolInvocation**: Handles execution logic with proper async operations
- **Type-Safe Interface**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive schemas
- **Error Prevention**: Validates operations before execution to prevent data loss

### Core Operations
1. **add_cell** - Insert new cells (code/markdown/raw) at any position
2. **edit_cell** - Modify cell content by index or ID while preserving metadata
3. **delete_cell** - Remove cells with protection against deleting the last cell
4. **move_cell** - Reorder cells within the notebook
5. **clear_outputs** - Remove execution outputs and reset execution counts

## Implementation Details

### 🔐 **Security & Reliability**
- **Crypto-secure Cell IDs**: Uses `randomBytes(4).toString('hex')` for unique cell identification
- **Absolute Path Validation**: Prevents relative path vulnerabilities
- **JSON Integrity**: Validates notebook structure before and after operations
- **Atomic Operations**: All changes validated before writing to prevent corruption

### ⚡ **Performance & Modern Practices**
- **Async File Operations**: Uses `fs.promises` for non-blocking I/O
- **Memory Efficient**: Direct JSON manipulation without external dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive interfaces
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful failure handling without data loss

### 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**
- **12 Unit Tests**: All operations and edge cases covered
- **Parameter Validation**: Path validation, file existence, JSON format checks
- **Error Handling**: Tests for invalid operations and edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality verification

## API Reference

### Tool Interface

```typescript
interface NotebookEditToolParams {
  absolute_path: string;              // Absolute path to notebook file
  operation: 'add_cell' | 'edit_cell' | 'delete_cell' | 'move_cell' | 'clear_outputs';
  cell_index?: number;                // 0-based index for cell operations
  cell_id?: string;                   // Alternative to cell_index
  cell_content?: string;              // Content for new/edited cells
  cell_type?: 'code' | 'markdown' | 'raw';  // Cell type (default: code)
  position?: number;                  // Position for new cells (default: end)
  source_index?: number;              // Source position for move operations
  destination_index?: number;         // Destination position for move operations
}
```

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Add Cell
```bash
# In Gemini CLI
> Use the notebook_edit tool to add a Python cell with content 'print("Hello World")' to my notebook.ipynb
```

#### 2. Edit Cell
```bash
# In Gemini CLI  
> Edit the first cell in notebook.ipynb to change the content to 'import pandas as pd'
```

#### 3. Delete Cell
```bash
# In Gemini CLI
> Delete the third cell from notebook.ipynb
```

#### 4. Move Cell
```bash
# In Gemini CLI
> Move the first cell to position 3 in notebook.ipynb
```

#### 5. Clear Outputs
```bash
# In Gemini CLI
> Clear all outputs from notebook.ipynb
```

## Implementation Files

### Core Implementation
1. **`packages/core/src/tools/notebook-edit.ts`** - Main NotebookEditTool class
2. **`packages/core/src/tools/notebook-edit.test.ts`** - Comprehensive test suite (12 tests)

### Integration
3. **`packages/cli/src/config.ts`** - Tool registration in CLI
4. **`packages/core/src/index.ts`** - Export declarations

### Testing
5. **`test-integration.mjs`** - Integration test script
6. **`helloworld_maths.ipynb`** - Test notebook for validation

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests (All Passing ✅)
```bash
cd packages/core
npx vitest run src/tools/notebook-edit.test.ts
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Parameter validation (relative paths, non-existent files, invalid JSON)
- ✅ Add cell operations (different types, positions)
- ✅ Edit cell operations (by index and ID)
- ✅ Delete cell operations (with last-cell protection)
- ✅ Move cell operations 
- ✅ Clear outputs operations
- ✅ JSON formatting preservation

### Integration Testing
```bash
node test-integration.mjs
```

### Manual Testing with Real Notebooks
The tool has been successfully tested with the provided `helloworld_maths.ipynb` calculator notebook.
