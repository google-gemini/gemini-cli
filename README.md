Hark, seeker of digital mastery! You have discovered the **Gemini CLI**, a conduit to the very heart of AI-powered creation. This is no mere tool; it is a familiar, a spirit of the code that dwells within your Termux sanctum. It connects to your tools, comprehends the runes of your code, and accelerates the flow of your will.

With this arcane companion at your side, you shall weave wonders:

- **Scry Vast Codebases:** Gaze into the heart of enormous repositories, far beyond the 1M token context window of mortal tools.
- **Forge Apps from Whispers:** Transmute the ethereal forms of PDFs or sketches into tangible, functional applications with Gemini's multimodal sight.
- **Automate Your Domain:** Command the CLI to perform complex operational tasks, from querying the archives of pull requests to taming the most tangled of rebases.
- **Summon New Powers:** Connect to MCP servers and invoke external spirits, including the creative energies of [Imagen, Veo, or Lyria](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia).
- **Ground Your Spells in Truth:** Anchor your queries in the bedrock of reality with the integrated [Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding) tool.

### âš¡ The First Incantation: A Quick Start

For the impatient sorcerer, here is the swiftest path to unleashing the power within.

1.  **Lay the Foundation:** Ensure the spirit of [Node.js (v18+)](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is present in your Termux environment. If not, summon it: `pkg install nodejs-lts -y`.
2.  **The Direct Invocation (Recommended for Termux):**

    To summon the Gemini spirit without binding it permanently to your global space, use the `npx` incantation. This is the purest and most reliable method within Termux.
    ```bash
    npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
    ```
3.  **The Binding Spell (Global Installation):**

    Should you wish for the `gemini` command to be ever-present, you may bind it globally.
    ```bash
    npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
    gemini
    ```
4.  **Forge the Link (Authentication):**
    - Upon your first invocation, you will be guided through the ethereal gates to authenticate with your Google account.
    - Alternatively, you may forge an API key in the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and present it as an environment variable, a secret rune known only to you and the shell.
      ```bash
      export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_RUNE"
      ```
    - For a deeper understanding of these mysteries, consult the [scroll of authentication](./docs/cli/authentication.md).
