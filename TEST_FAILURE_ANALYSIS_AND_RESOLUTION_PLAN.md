# Test Failure Analysis & Resolution Plan

This document details the test failures encountered during the `npm run preflight` command and the step-by-step plan to resolve them.

---

## 1. `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useCompletion.test.ts`

### Failure Details

-   **Test:** `useCompletion > File Path Completion (` @`) > Basic Completion > should use glob for top-level @ completions when available`
-   **Error:** `AssertionError: expected [] to have a length of 2 but got +0`
-   **Location:** `src/ui/hooks/useCompletion.test.ts:810:44`

### Analysis

The test expects file and directory suggestions when a user types `@s`, but it receives none. The root cause is that the `glob` function, as currently used, does not return directories in its results, only files. The test setup includes a directory (`src`) and a file within another directory (`derp/script.ts`) that should match.

### Resolution Plan

1.  **Modify `glob` Usage:** I will update the `glob` call within the `findFilesWithGlob` function in `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useCompletion.ts`.
2.  **Add `mark: true` Option:** I will add the `mark: true` option to the `glob` configuration. This option appends a `/` to all returned directory paths.
3.  **Verify Suggestions:** This change will ensure that directories are included in the results, allowing the test to find the expected `src/` directory and `derp/script.ts` file, resolving the assertion error.

## 2. `packages/core/src/services/loopDetectionService.test.ts`

### Failure Details

-   **Test:** `LoopDetectionService > Content Loop Detection > should not detect a loop if repetitions are very far apart`
-   **Error:** `Error: Test timed out in 5000ms.`
-   **Location:** `src/services/loopDetectionService.test.ts:164:5`

### Analysis

The test, which checks for loops in content with widely spaced repetitions, is timing out. This indicates a significant performance issue in the `detect` method of the `LoopDetectionService`. The current algorithm is likely using an inefficient method (e.g., `indexOf` on a growing string) to find repetitions, which does not scale for very long content streams.

### Resolution Plan

1.  **Analyze `loopDetectionService.ts`:** I will read the source code of the `detect` method to confirm the algorithm and identify the performance bottleneck.
2.  **Implement an Efficient Algorithm:** I will replace the inefficient loop detection logic. Instead of searching the entire history buffer on every invocation, I will implement a more optimized approach. A possible solution is to only check for a loop when the content buffer doubles in size, which prevents the check from running on every single character and makes the check less frequent as the content grows.
3.  **Modify `loopDetectionService.ts`:** I will apply the optimized algorithm directly to the `addAndCheck` method within the `LoopDetectionService`.
4.  **Verify the Fix:** I will run the `npm run preflight` command to ensure the test passes within the original 5000ms timeout and that no other tests have been broken by the change. This approach fixes the root cause of the performance issue rather than just accommodating it with a longer timeout.
