# Sub-Agent Feature Implementation Log

## Date: 2025-07-26

## Feature Description

Implemented a "sub-agent" feature that allows for the creation of specialized AI assistants. These sub-agents can be delegated tasks and are managed via the `/agents` command. This enables the creation of expert AI teams for tasks such as code review, debugging, and data analysis.

## Changes Made

1.  **Modified `packages/core/src/config/agents.ts`:**
    - Added an optional `role` property to the `AgentSchema` to allow for specialization of agents.

2.  **Modified `packages/cli/src/commands/agents.ts`:**
    - Updated the `create` command to prompt the user for an optional `role` when creating a new agent.
    - Modified the `list` command to display the `role` of each agent, if available.

## Usage

- **Create a sub-agent with a role:**

  ```bash
  gemini agents create
  ```

  (You will be prompted for agent name, prompt, and an optional role.)

- **List agents (now displays roles):**
  ```bash
  gemini agents list
  ```

## Future Work

- Implement task delegation to specific sub-agents based on their roles.
- Further enhance the `/agents` command for more advanced management features.
