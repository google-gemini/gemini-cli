## Key Performance Indicators

### Compliance Success Rate
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_prs,
  SUM(CASE WHEN compliance_status = 'passed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as compliant_prs,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN compliance_status = 'passed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as compliance_rate
FROM pr_compliance_events
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
```

### Zone Review Response Times
```sql
SELECT
  zone_name,
  AVG(response_time_hours) as avg_response_time,
  MIN(response_time_hours) as min_response_time,
  MAX(response_time_hours) as max_response_time,
  COUNT(*) as total_reviews
FROM zone_reviews
WHERE review_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY zone_name
ORDER BY avg_response_time ASC
```

### Top Compliance Failure Reasons
```sql
SELECT
  failure_reason,
  COUNT(*) as frequency,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM compliance_failures
WHERE failure_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY failure_reason
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## Emergency Procedures

### System Outage Response
1. **Immediate**: Check GitHub Actions status
2. **Assessment**: Identify root cause (API limits, configuration, code)
3. **Mitigation**: Enable maintenance mode if needed
4. **Recovery**: Restore from backup configurations
5. **Post-mortem**: Document and prevent recurrence

### Security Incident Response
1. **Containment**: Disable affected workflows
2. **Investigation**: Audit logs and access patterns
3. **Recovery**: Rotate compromised credentials
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders and team
5. **Prevention**: Update security rules and monitoring

## Expert Commands

### System Health Check
```bash
# Check workflow status
gh workflow list --repo your-org/your-repo

# View recent compliance runs
gh run list --workflow="PR Compliance & Security Enforcement" --limit 10

# Check compliance labels
gh pr list --label "compliance:failed" --limit 5
```

### Emergency Controls
```bash
# Enable maintenance mode
gh variable set MAINTENANCE_MODE --body true

# Disable compliance enforcement
gh workflow disable "PR Compliance & Security Enforcement"

# Re-enable system
gh workflow enable "PR Compliance & Security Enforcement"
gh variable delete MAINTENANCE_MODE
```
