"""
The `symbolism` package defines the cognitive nodes and symbolic structures
that represent the Sephirot and Qliphoth in the Crisalida project.

This includes the individual node implementations (e.g., Keter, Binah, Thaumiel),
enumerations for the tree structures, and the definitions for the symbolic
sigils that form the basis of the divine language.
