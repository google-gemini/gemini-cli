# Gemini CLI Multi-Agent System

## Overview

The Gemini CLI includes a **96-agent multi-agent system** for intelligent task delegation, specialized execution, and automated quality assurance.

## Key Features

### 96 Specialized Agents

The system includes agents for:
- Code Generation (8 agents)
- Testing & QA (6 agents)
- Security (3 agents)
- Database (3 agents)
- API Development (3 agents)
- DevOps & Infrastructure (3 agents)
- Performance (3 agents)
- Documentation (3 agents)
- And 60+ more specialized agents

### Intelligent Delegation

The coordinator automatically selects optimal agents based on task complexity:

- **Simple tasks** (3-5 agents): "What is 2+2?"
- **Moderate tasks** (5-10 agents): "Add a login button"
- **Complex tasks** (10-20 agents): "Build authentication system"
- **Large tasks** (20+ agents): "Build e-commerce platform"

### 3-Layer Completion Enforcement

1. **Ultra-Strict Rules**: Forbids stopping mid-task, forbids planning without execution
2. **Mandatory Checklist**: 8-point verification including testing, production-ready status, no placeholders
3. **Response Blocker**: 5 checks before every response to ensure completeness

### 8 Mandatory Quality Assurance Agents

These agents run for EVERY task to ensure baseline quality:

1. **analyzer-1** - Requirements analysis and clarification
2. **validator-1** - Input validation
3. **validator-2** - Output validation
4. **formatter-1** - Code formatting
5. **error-handler-1** - Error handling enforcement
6. **linter-1** - Code linting
7. **verifier** - Final cross-verification
8. **integrator** - Final integration and assembly

### Cost Optimization

- All agents use **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for consistent, cost-effective execution
- ~$0.08 per 10-agent task
- 73% savings compared to Claude-based approaches

## How It Works

When you submit a task to Gemini CLI:

1. **Coordinator analyzes** your request
2. **Determines complexity** and selects optimal agents
3. **Spawns specialized agents** to work in parallel
4. **8 mandatory QA agents** run to verify quality
5. **Coordinator integrates** agent outputs
6. **Delivers production-ready** results with zero placeholders

## Usage

```bash
# Use the multi-agent system for any task
gemini-cli --agents --task "Build a REST API with user authentication"

# The system will:
# - Analyze requirements
# - Design the API structure
# - Generate backend code
# - Create database schema
# - Add security validation
# - Write comprehensive tests
# - Generate API documentation
# - Format and lint code
# - Verify everything works
# - Deliver production-ready implementation
```

## Benefits

✅ **Specialized Expertise** - Each agent focuses on specific tasks
✅ **Parallel Execution** - Multiple agents work simultaneously
✅ **Automated QA** - 8 mandatory agents verify every task
✅ **Production-Ready** - Zero placeholders, fully tested code
✅ **Cost-Effective** - All Gemini 2.5 Pro (~$0.08/10 agents)
✅ **Intelligent** - Automatic agent selection based on task complexity

## Configuration

All 96 agents are configured in `agents/config.json` with:

- **Model**: gemini-2.5-pro (consistent across all agents)
- **Temperature**: Optimized per agent role (0.2-0.4)
- **Mandatory flags**: Identified for QA agents
- **Roles**: Categorized for intelligent delegation
