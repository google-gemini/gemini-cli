# Migrating a Codebase

This tutorial shows you how to use Gemini CLI to help you migrate a codebase from one framework to another.

## 1. Start Gemini CLI

Start Gemini CLI in the root directory of your project:

```bash
gemini
```

## 2. Create a plan

Ask Gemini to create a plan for migrating your codebase. For example, if you are migrating from Express to Koa, you could ask:

```
> Create a plan for migrating this Express codebase to Koa.
```

Gemini will provide you with a step-by-step plan for migrating your codebase.

## 3. Implement the plan

Implement the plan one step at a time. You can ask Gemini to help you with each step. For example, you could ask:

```
> Convert the Express routes in routes/index.js to Koa routes.
```

Gemini will provide you with the converted code.

## 4. Test your code

After each step, test your code to make sure that everything is working as expected.

## 5. Repeat

Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have migrated your entire codebase.
