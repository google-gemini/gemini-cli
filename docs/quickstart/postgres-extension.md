# Quickstart: Using the Generic PostgreSQL Extension

Gemini CLI includes a pre-built extension for connecting to any PostgreSQL database, allowing you to query and manage your database using natural language.

This guide covers how to activate and configure this extension.

## Installation

```bash
gemini extensions install github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/postgres.git
```

## Prerequisites

### Set up the database

1. Create or select a PostgreSQL instance.

    * [Install PostgreSQL locally](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
    * [Install AlloyDB Omni](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/omni/current/docs/quickstart)

1. Create or reuse [a database
   user](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/omni/current/docs/database-users/manage-users)
   and have the username and password ready.

## Configuration

After activating the extension, configure it by setting the following environment variables:

- `POSTGRES_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server.
- `POSTGRES_PORT`: The port number for the PostgreSQL server.
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The database username.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.
- `POSTGRES_QUERY_PARAMS`: (Optional) Raw query to be added to the db connection string.

### Permissions

Ensure the configured database user has the necessary database-level permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`) to execute the desired queries.

## Usage Examples

### A Developer's Story

This section follows a developer, Alex, as they use the PostgreSQL extension to diagnose a slow user profile page in their application.

#### Step 1: Exploring the Schema

Alex's first step is to understand the database structure related to user profiles.

> "List all tables in the database."
*Tool Used*: `list_tables`

#### Step 2: Analyzing the Slow Query

After identifying the `users` and `user_profiles` tables, Alex suspects the query joining them is inefficient. They decide to check the execution plan.

> "What is the execution plan for the query 'SELECT * FROM users u JOIN user_profiles up ON u.id = up.user_id WHERE u.id = 123'?"
*Tool Used*: `get_query_plan`

#### Step 3: Discovering an Indexing Problem

The query plan reveals a slow sequential scan. Alex wonders if there's an issue with the indexes on the tables.

> "Show me all invalid indexes."
*Tool Used*: `list_invalid_indexes`

#### Step 4: Checking Overall Database Health

Finding an invalid index prompts Alex to run a broader health check, looking for other common performance issues like table bloat.

> "Show me the top 10 most bloated tables."
*Tool Used*: `list_top_bloated_tables`

### Conclusion

In just a few minutes, using natural language, Alex has gone from a vague performance complaint to a concrete action plan: fix the invalid index and address table bloat. This demonstrates how the extension can accelerate development and debugging workflows.

### Data Analyst Journey: Extracting Data for a Report

Maria, a data analyst, needs to pull data for a sales report.

#### Step 1: Find Relevant Tables
Maria starts by looking for tables related to sales and customers.
> "List all tables that have 'sales' or 'customers' in their names."
*Tool Used*: `list_tables`

#### Step 2: Explore Table Schemas
To understand how to join them, she inspects the schemas.
> "Show me the schema for the 'sales' and 'customers' tables."
*Tool Used*: `execute_sql`

#### Step 3: Query the Data
Maria writes a query to get the total sales for each customer.
> "Write a SQL query to get the total sales amount for each customer by joining the 'sales' and 'customers' tables on the customer ID."
*Tool Used*: `execute_sql`

#### Step 4: Save the Results
She saves the data to a CSV file for her report.
> "Save the results of the previous query to a file named 'sales_by_customer.csv'."
*Tool Used*: `write_file`

### Database Administrator (DBA) Journey: Routine Maintenance

David, a DBA, performs his daily checks to ensure the database is healthy.

#### Step 1: Check for Long-Running Queries
David looks for queries that might be slowing down the system.
> "Are there any queries that have been running for more than 10 minutes?"
*Tool Used*: `execute_sql` (querying `pg_stat_activity`)

#### Step 2: Review Autovacuum Configurations
He reviews the autovacuum settings to ensure they are optimized for the workload.
> "Show me the autovacuum configurations."
*Tool Used*: `list_autovacuum_configurations`

#### Step 3: Check Memory Configurations
David checks the memory-related configurations to prevent performance bottlenecks.
> "List all memory-related configurations."
*Tool Used*: `list_memory_configurations`

#### Step 4: Monitor Database Size
He checks the overall size of the database to track its growth.
> "What's the total size of the database?"
*Tool Used*: `execute_sql` (using `pg_database_size()`)

#### Step 5: Verify Replication Status
David ensures that the read replicas are in sync.
> "Show me the current replication status and lag."
*Tool Used*: `list_replication_slots`

#### Step 6: Initiate a Backup
He kicks off a manual backup of a critical database.
> "Create a backup of the 'production' database and store it in the '/backups' directory."
*Tool Used*: `run_shell_command` (using `pg_dump`)

### New Developer Onboarding Journey: Learning the Ropes

Sarah, a new developer, is getting acquainted with the project's database.

#### Step 1: Get an Overview
Her first step is to see all the tables in the database.
> "List all the tables in the database."
*Tool Used*: `list_tables`

#### Step 2: Examine a Table
She decides to dive deeper into the `products` table.
> "Show me the columns and their data types for the 'products' table."
*Tool Used*: `execute_sql`

#### Step 3: Preview Table Data
Sarah wants to see some sample data to understand the content.
> "Show me the first 5 rows from the 'products' table."
*Tool Used*: `execute_sql`

#### Step 4: Understand Table Relationships
She wants to know how products relate to other tables.
> "What are the foreign key relationships for the 'products' table?"
*Tool Used*: `execute_sql`
