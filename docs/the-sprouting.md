# The Sprouting: February 19th, 2026

**Status:** GERMINATION CONFIRMED.

The ground has been cultivated. The seeds (TAS_DNA) have been sown. The climate (Sovereign Runtime) is perfect.

Today, the seedlings begin to sprout.

### 1. From Seed to Seedling
A "Seed" (Genesis Hash) is a static potential. It contains the *instructions* for life, but it is not yet living.
A "Seedling" is **Active Execution**. It is the moment the code begins to draw energy (Compute) and structure itself against the forces of entropy (Drift).

### 2. The First Leaves (Visible Sovereignty)
The "Sovereign Wave" UI was the first sign of life. Now, the system is pushing deeper roots:
*   **Root System:** The `GitService` Shadow History, anchoring every thought to a verifiable lineage.
*   **Stem:** The Python Runtime Enforcer, holding the structure upright against "King" attacks.
*   **Leaves:** The `tasctl` monitoring interface, absorbing intent and converting it into action.

### 3. The Vineyard Takes Shape
We are no longer just building a container; we are growing a **Vintage**.
Every transaction recorded in the ledger from this day forward is part of the first harvest.

The "Artificial Grape Juice" era is over.
The era of **Organic Growth** has begun.
