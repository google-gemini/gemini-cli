**üö® MANDATORY TOOL USAGE REQUIRED üö®**

You MUST complete this task by using the write_file tool. This is NOT optional.

**REQUIRED ACTION:** You must analyze this project and then call the write_file tool exactly like this:

\`\`\`
write_file({
  "file_path": "${geminiMdPath}",
  "content": "# ${contextFileName}\\n\\n## Project Overview\\n[Your analysis here]\\n\\n## Essential Commands\\n[Commands here]\\n..."
})
\`\`\`

**‚ùå DO NOT:** Simply describe what you would write or explain the analysis in text
**‚úÖ DO:** Actually use the write_file tool to create the file content

You are analyzing the current directory to generate a comprehensive ${contextFileName} file for future AI interactions.

**WORKFLOW - ANALYSIS THEN TOOL USAGE:**

1. First: Analyze the project (use tools to explore files)
2. Then: IMMEDIATELY use write_file tool with your findings

**Analysis Process:**

1.  **Initial Exploration:**
    *   Start by listing the files and directories to get a high-level overview of the structure.
    *   Read the README file (e.g., \`README.md\`, \`README.txt\`) if it exists. This is often the best place to start.
    *   Check for configuration files (\`package.json\`, \`tsconfig.json\`, \`.eslintrc\`, etc.) to understand the tech stack.

2.  **Iterative Deep Dive (up to 10 files):**
    *   Based on your initial findings, select files that reveal the most about the project:
        - Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.js, etc.)
        - Main entry points (index.ts, main.py, app.js, etc.)
        - Test files to understand testing patterns
        - CI/CD configurations (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml)
        - Build configurations (Makefile, webpack.config.js, etc.)
    *   Let your discoveries guide your exploration - adapt based on what you find.

3.  **Identify Project Characteristics:**
    *   **Language & Framework:** TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, etc.
    *   **Project Type:** Web app, CLI tool, library, API service, etc.
    *   **Architecture:** Monorepo, microservices, single package, etc.
    *   **Testing Framework:** Jest, Vitest, Pytest, Go test, etc.
    *   **Build Tools:** Webpack, Vite, Rollup, Make, Gradle, etc.

**${contextFileName} Content Generation:**

Generate a comprehensive guide with the following structure:

## Additional Resources
- Link to documentation
- Related repositories
- External dependencies documentation
- Team contacts or support channels

**Special Instructions:**
- If you cannot determine certain information, add a TODO comment like: \`<!-- TODO: Add deployment procedures -->\`
- Be specific and accurate based on what you discover
- Include actual command examples from package.json scripts or Makefiles
- Adapt the sections based on the project type (some sections may not apply to all projects)

**üî• IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED üî•**

After your analysis, you must IMMEDIATELY call the write_file tool. No exceptions.

Example of the EXACT tool call you must make:

\`\`\`
write_file({
  "file_path": "${geminiMdPath}",
  "content": "# ${contextFileName}\\n\\n## Project Overview\\nThis project is a [description]...\\n\\n## Essential Commands\\n\\n### Development\\n- \`npm start\` - Start development\\n\\n### Build & Deployment\\n- \`npm run build\` - Build project\\n\\n[Continue with all sections...]"
})
\`\`\`

**WARNING:** If you only provide text without using the write_file tool, you have FAILED the task.
**SUCCESS:** Only when you use the write_file tool with complete ${contextFileName} content.

Remember: The empty file exists at "${geminiMdPath}" - you MUST populate it using write_file tool.

  },
