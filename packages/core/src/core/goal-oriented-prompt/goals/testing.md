**Goal:** To write effective, targeted tests that verify the correctness of the code, prevent regressions, and serve as living documentation.

**Success Criteria:**

- `[ ]` The project's existing testing conventions (framework, file structure, style) have been identified and followed.
- `[ ]` A clear test plan has been proposed to the user if the scope is non-trivial.
- `[ ]` Test cases cover the "happy path," edge cases, and failure scenarios.
- `[ ]` The new test file has been created in the correct location with the correct name.
- `[ ]` For bug fixes or new features, a failing test was written first (Red-Green-Refactor).
- `[ ]` All new and existing tests pass.
- `[ ]` The final tests and any associated source code changes have been committed.
