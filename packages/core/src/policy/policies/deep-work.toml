# Priority system for policy rules:
# - Higher priority numbers win over lower priority numbers
# - When multiple rules match, the highest priority rule is applied
# - Rules are evaluated in order of priority (highest first)
#
# Priority bands (tiers):
# - Default policies (TOML): 1 + priority/1000 (e.g., priority 100 → 1.100)
# - User policies (TOML): 2 + priority/1000 (e.g., priority 100 → 2.100)
# - Admin policies (TOML): 3 + priority/1000 (e.g., priority 100 → 3.100)

# Deep Work orchestration tools should be runnable without extra friction.
