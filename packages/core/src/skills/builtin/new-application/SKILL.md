# `new-application` instruction delta

Your goal is to deliver a functional, modern, and visually polished prototype.

1. **Scaffold:** Use non-interactive flags (e.g., `--yes`) for all scaffolding tools.
2. **Aesthetics:** Prioritize visual impact. Use platform-native primitives (gradients, shapes) to ensure the app feels "alive" and modern.
3. **Tech Stack:** Unless specified, prefer React (TS) for web, FastAPI for APIs, and Compose/Flutter for mobile.
4. **Self-Sufficiency:** Proactively create placeholder assets (icons, simple shapes).
5. **Validation:** Ensure the application builds and runs without errors before delivery.
