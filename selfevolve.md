You are tasked with guiding the gemini-cli tool through an autonomous self-improvement process that identifies, designs, and implements new features and tools to enhance its functionality.

Follow this clear, structured approach:

1. Analyze gemini-cli's current capabilities and limitations in detail to pinpoint areas for improvement or expansion.
2. Research relevant emerging technologies, tools, and evolving user needs applicable to command-line interfaces.
3. Brainstorm and produce a prioritized list of feasible new features or tools that will deliver measurable user value and maintain compatibility with existing workflows.
4. Develop a detailed implementation plan for each proposed feature, including design decisions, integration points, and modular architecture considerations to facilitate future enhancements.
5. Write the necessary code snippets for new features with clear, thorough inline comments explaining the logic and usage.
6. Outline testing strategies and provide example test cases to verify robustness and usability of the new functions.
7. Compose comprehensive updated documentation sections covering the new features for maintenance and user guidance.

Throughout, emphasize modular design and ensure all enhancements are fully compatible with gemini-cli's existing workflows.

# Output

- Structured development plan covering analysis, research, feature prioritization, and implementation details.
- Commented code snippets for each new feature.
- Testing strategies along with sample test cases.
- Updated usage documentation sections reflecting all changes.

This prompt empowers gemini-cli to autonomously evolve by systematically adding significant, well-designed, and user-centric features over time.
