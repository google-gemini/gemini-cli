# Intelligent MCP Plugin Ecosystem

## Overview

This system creates a self-organizing, intelligent ecosystem where **plugins manage MCP servers** and **MCP servers spawn plugins**, creating a bidirectional, context-aware plugin management system with real-time synchronization and persistent memory.

## Core Architecture

### ðŸ”„ Bidirectional Management
- **Plugins control MCP servers** - Plugins can start, stop, and configure MCP servers
- **MCP servers spawn plugins** - Servers can dynamically create specialized plugins based on needs
- **Mutual orchestration** - Plugins and servers work together through the Guidance system

### ðŸ§  Intelligence Layer (Guidance.js)
- **Code analysis** - Analyzes scenarios to determine optimal plugin/MCP actions
- **Pattern recognition** - Learns from interactions to improve decision-making
- **Dynamic spawning** - Creates specialized agents based on context and requirements

### ðŸ’¾ Persistent Context Memory (VFS)
- **Agent memory** - Each agent maintains persistent conversation history and learned patterns
- **Sync state** - Real-time synchronization of context across agents
- **Prompt integration** - Context memory can be fed into prompts for enhanced interactions

### ðŸ“¡ Real-time Synchronization
- **WebSocket broadcasting** - Agents sync context in real-time
- **Conflict resolution** - Intelligent merging of conflicting context updates
- **Peer communication** - Agents communicate and coordinate through the sync system

## Key Components

### 1. MCPPluginManager (Core Orchestrator)
```typescript
const ecosystem = new IntelligentMCPEcosystem(vfs, guidance);

// Process queries with intelligent agent orchestration
const response = await ecosystem.processQuery("Refactor this legacy code", ["agent1", "agent2"]);

// Spawn specialized agents dynamically
const agentId = await ecosystem.spawnSpecializedAgent("code_generation", "refactoring");
```

### 2. SubAgent System (Dynamic Specialization)
- **Auto-spawning** - Agents created based on Guidance analysis
- **Specialization** - Each agent has specific capabilities (code gen, analysis, conflict resolution)
- **Context sync** - Real-time sharing of learned patterns and state
- **MCP integration** - Agents can communicate with MCP servers

### 3. ContextSyncManager (Real-time Sync)
- **WebSocket broadcasting** - Live context synchronization
- **VFS persistence** - Context stored in Virtual File System
- **Conflict resolution** - Intelligent merging of context updates
- **History tracking** - Full audit trail of context changes

### 4. PromptContextIntegrator (Prompt Enhancement)
```typescript
// Build prompts with agent context
const enrichedPrompt = await integrator.buildPromptContext(
  "Help me refactor this code",
  ["analysis-agent", "code-gen-agent"],
  true, // include history
  5    // max history items
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Query Processing
```typescript
const ecosystem = new IntelligentMCPEcosystem(vfs, guidance);

// Simple query with intelligent processing
const response = await ecosystem.processQuery(
  "How should I optimize this database query?",
  ["performance-agent"] // Use specific agent context
);
```

### Collaborative Multi-Agent Tasks
```typescript
// Spawn team of specialized agents
const agents = await Promise.all([
  ecosystem.spawnSpecializedAgent("analysis", "query_optimization"),
  ecosystem.spawnSpecializedAgent("code_generation", "sql_refactoring"),
  ecosystem.spawnSpecializedAgent("conflict_resolution", "merge_strategies")
]);

// Process with full team context
const result = await ecosystem.processQuery(
  "Optimize this complex query with proper indexing",
  agents // All agents contribute context
);
```

### Plugin-MCP Bidirectional Management
```typescript
// Plugin can start/manage MCP server
const serverId = await plugin.startMCPServer({
  name: "Code Analysis Server",
  capabilities: ["analysis", "refactoring"],
  plugins: ["syntax-checker", "performance-analyzer"]
});

// MCP server can spawn plugins dynamically
await mcpServer.spawnPlugin({
  type: "code_generation",
  specialization: "typescript_refactoring",
  context: currentAnalysis
});
```

## Advanced Features

### Learning & Adaptation
- **Pattern recognition** - Agents learn successful strategies
- **Confidence scoring** - Decisions improve over time
- **Adaptive spawning** - Better agent selection based on history

### Context Persistence
- **VFS storage** - All context persisted in Virtual File System
- **Crash recovery** - Agents can resume from saved state
- **History analysis** - Learning from past interactions

### Real-time Collaboration
- **Live sync** - Agents share insights instantly
- **Conflict resolution** - Intelligent merging of competing solutions
- **Coordination** - Agents work together on complex tasks

## Integration Points

### With Gemini CLI
