ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Code Analysis: Security & Quality Intelligence

Comprehensive code analysis system with security vulnerability detection and quality metrics.

âœ… Advanced code pattern analysis and classification
âœ… Security vulnerability detection (injection, XSS, weak crypto)
âœ… Quality metrics (maintainability index, cyclomatic complexity)
âœ… Improvement suggestions with refactoring recommendations
âœ… Alternative implementation strategies with scoring

**ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes (v1.1):**
- âœ… Enhanced file integrity with SHA-256 cryptographic hashing for collision-resistant conflict detection
- âœ… Prevented ReDoS vulnerability with proper regex escaping in pattern matching
- âœ… Implemented actual memory calculations for recovery agent instead of hardcoded estimates
- âœ… Added CODE_GENERATION agent type for proper dispatching logic
- âœ… Fixed maintainabilityIndex calculation to handle zero-value edge cases
- âœ… Enhanced Halstead Volume calculation with proper regex operator escaping
- âœ… Simplified analyzeAndGuide return type for consistency and type safety
