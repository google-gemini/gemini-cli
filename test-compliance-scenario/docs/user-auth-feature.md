# User Authentication Feature

## Overview
The new user authentication system provides secure, scalable authentication
for the Gemini CLI application.

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- API keys are loaded from environment variables only
- Never store keys in source code or configuration files
- Rotate keys regularly according to security policy

### Data Protection
- User passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Session tokens are cryptographically secure random values
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit

### Audit Logging
- Authentication attempts are logged without sensitive data
- Failed login attempts trigger security monitoring
- All security events are retained for compliance

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
USER_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/gemini_cli
SESSION_SECRET=your-cryptographically-secure-session-secret
```

## Compliance

This feature complies with:
- SOC 2 Type II security requirements
- GDPR data protection regulations
- ISO 27001 information security standards
