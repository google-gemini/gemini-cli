I realized yesterday that my `gcloud` was still set to use `aipp-internal-testing` as the application default credentials, so I switched it to my personal project to do something unrelated. Now that it's my personal project, Duet in VSCode doesn't work. Does my application default credentials have to be `aipp-internal-testing` even though I have set `cloudcode.duetAI.project` to my personal project? It seems like despite changing that field in my VSCode settings, the Staging API in my project has had no traffic.

A while ago I followed the steps set up my personal Pantheon project (google.com not joonix) to be my `cloudcode.duetAI.project`. I realized yesterday that my `gcloud` was still set to use `aipp-internal-testing` as the application default credentials, so I switched it to my personal project to do something unrelated. Now that it's my personal project, Duet in VSCode doesn't work. Does my application default credentials have to be `aipp-internal-testing` even though I have set `cloudcode.duetAI.project` to my personal project? It seems like despite changing that field in my VSCode settings, the Staging API in my project has had no traffic.

*Hello All,



One of our ideas which we are trying internally (in our Team here in Pune, India) is to make the most effective use of Gemini and Bison models to help SCEs create Test scripts, given the input in natural language. Later maybe the code can also be the input for which we would like to generate the test cases.

_Steps:_

- *Step 1 (Initial Test):* Scan a single code file (.py/.java/.txt) uploaded to a GCS bucket. Gemini should analyze and provide remediation suggestions.

_Constraints:_

- Customer wants to conduct the hackathon exclusively using Colab Notebooks

- They are already allow listed for 1.5 pro as well. The preference is to use the same during hackathon

- No use of AI Studio.

_Key Questions:_

- Is this overall approach feasible using only Colab Notebooks?

- Are there example notebooks for Steps 1-3 that can guide our hackathon setup?

- Can Gemini directly process Java/Python/C++ files from GCS? despite its multi modal capability, I don't think it is feasible to process them directly. If not, are there examples demonstrating the necessary pre-conversion process?

> My understanding - is that if a single user is accessing Code Assist via multiple projects, they only need one license so long as all those projects use the same billing id. If they access across billing ID - they would need multiple licenses. Note in practice this shouldn't be an issue. Accessing the CodeAssist APIs from a single project can be used to author code to deploy to ANY project.

Use case:

- We have a number of codelabs, demos, etc. in DevRel that we support.

- We need to make sure that as the model's evolve and improve that there aren't any issues with the prompts we're recommending folks use.

Right now the only way I've found to do this is either reactive (wait till someone reports a bug in the lab) or human time intensive (review the content we maintain manually on a regular basis).

If we could send the prompts and get back answers I feel like there's a reasonable chance we could verify code generated by Gemini or the answers in the chat are similar enough that the labs and demos won't break.

> @Karan Kapoor we're talking to several customers about this scenario right now. You can plug me into the conversation, if you like. The short answer is that we're using the Gemini foundational model, not codey for this purpose. Feeding the entire code base into 1.5 is possible, but we can only get 8k token back out, so we're playing with strategies to feed in the entire repo and get back instructions on a file by file basis, rather than asking the model to convert the whole repo at once.

Open a file in the editor and ask the same question in the chat again => Chat refuses to answer and says `The provided  YAML  file does not contain any information about Google Pub/Sub.`

This was a session during the conference that I attended this week- https://odsc.com/boston

Folks from Nvidia & HP talked about their customer engagements where GenAI Code generation and code assistant resulted in productivity gains - $60M.

They measured time(hours) for new features implementation and deployment after GenAI was deployed and then multiplied that buy some hourly rate to come up with $60M.

productivity gains = hours saved with GenAI.

and that approach can be extended for troubleshooting / DevOps space / etc.

And, ultimately, how that subscription/licensing model would change once they achieve independence?Hi Folks. Is this the right place for Gemini Code Assist subscription and billing questions?

I have an internal customer, Google Fiber (they're a Bet), who are in the process of spinning out of Google and becoming an independent business entity. This transition will run through next year (2025) and the GFiber team will retain their "internal" Cloud customer status during this period and remain eligible for internal GCP pricing.

Is there a team I can connect my GFiber counterpart with to discuss how a ~75 user internal Code Assist subscription and cross-charge model would work? And, ultimately, how that subscription/licensing model would change once they achieve independence?

Could you help me with a question please?

I recently ran a test on my personal GCP account and noticed that, even without an active billing account,

- it was possible to activate chat in the Google Cloud console to answer questions

- display the output of "Explain this log entry" from cloud logging

- enable integration with Visual Studio Code

I understand that all of this was possible, because of the campaign below:

"Gemini Code Assist is available to try at no cost until July 11, 2024, limited to one user per billing account."

But on July 12th, in the case of this personal account, all the features listed must be deactivated

Is my understanding correct?

I thought we had a doc somewhere around networking. For general firewalls, there are two APIs they need to enable:

1. cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com

2. cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com

We're transitioning from (1) to (2); an MSA will be coming soon.

I just encountered the issue, and here is some log https://paste.googleplex.com/4705215408504832

This is non-deterministic (typical LLM!) and sometimes it returns (pretty long) code for the same request.

I observed this license restriction issue often when the request is for a very general problem (IMO).

In this example, I asked to generate a go code to read a csv format file. I assume there are plenty of examples with acceptable licenses and I wonder why this is an issue. Is it possible to exclude or rank lower the potentially problematic sources from training?

Also the code length limit 120 is ... very short for typical Go :-) Is it possible to increase the length for go?

We encountered the same issue during our demo last week when trying to generate enum for months `const (Jan, Feb, ...) ` in go.

just checking do gemini (code assist/general gemini) have capabilities to provide a code summary notification ?

like help to add comment summarizing the changes in every PR/Merge along with the notification ?

just thinking would build some webhook for this activity, but would like understand if we have some kind of plugin/connectors to do this to help dev team ?

_in her words- _

e.g. I have a chat/session open and I want it to run regularly and maintain its own context over a few days. Say a prompt an hour for a week -- 24x7= 168 prompts On the last day, do a cross comparision to all the prompts for a weekly sinopsis. Meaning it would need that prior context. Is that possible to do in session without having to do a 'store prompt & reply on disk locally' jiggery-pokery?

_My understanding is- _

- It is not something publicly documented and could vary based on multiple factors (complexity of the conversations, context of the discussion, context window etc. ).

- There doesn't seem to be a hard limit, but the model's ability to recall specific prompts diminishes over time.

- Maintaining context across multiple days is challenging and not supported currently. It would likely require custom solutions, such as storing the conversation externally and re-injecting previous conversation history

P.S- Regarding the session context, if we go to <http://gemini.gogle.com|gemini.gogle.com> or <http://goto.google.com/bard|go/bard>, the chat context and activity is stored for a max of 72 hours. it is my understanding that after 72 hours, all your session context and activities are lost. However, the API documentation for Gemini doesn't specify anything about it as part of _GenerationConfig_, so I am guessing its all under the hood and not publicly available

Apart from this, is there anything else that I should be adding?

Additionally, is there any publicly sharable info around the above line that anyone is aware of?

When I click the star in the bottom right, it says I need to sign in, but when I click the button, it just spins forever with no prompt to sign in anywhere in sight.

The Cloud Code Extension is connected to a project I own (in a joonix org, if that makes a difference) and I have enabled the Cloud Companion API and given myself the appropriate IAM in that project.

But for my first testing, the suggested code is quite weird.

Ex. ask for "generate a function to list files in gcs bucket"

The result is bad when I ask in a file with some codes. But it does work if it is a blank new file

Is this intended? My customer is looking forward to Cmd+I, so better to know how should it use for as this is not the same on Cloud Shell.

I really really really love gemini, is my favorite family of models, and I really trust google more than other companies with having access to my computer, so naturally I'll love to have gemini code assist as my genAI assistant for coding tasks, and I am kind of already using it when I use project IDX, but 70% of the time when I code for fun I am using my favorite code editor ever, NVIM, and it has come to my attention that there is not such thing as gemini for vim, so I wanted to know if the vscode extension is open source and where it resides or uses open protocols so I can have hope that putting some work into it I can convert it into a nvim plugin.

I would really appreciate it if you can give me any leads that could help me have this working, or at least kill my hope with fire as fast as possible showing proof/telling me that this is 100% using closed source protocols.

I am currently on vscode extension v2.12.0. (not sure when I got out of dogfood...)

After trying the "generate code" feature (eventually, I didn't accept the generated code due to UI confusion), I noticed a citation-related diagnostic show up in an untitled document that is a copy of my own code (probably created when I ran "generate code").

```

[{

    "resource": "Untitled-2",

    "owner": "_generated_diagnostic_collection_name_#9",

    "severity": 4,

    "message": "Use code with caution, suggested code may be subject to licenses\nhttp://qqailab.cn/2019/06/16/go-package-unsafe.html\nLicense unknown",

    "source": "Powered by Gemini",

    "startLineNumber": 342,

    "startColumn": 54,

    "endLineNumber": 347,

    "endColumn": 41

}]

```

The code was as generic like

```

343:

344:    hostOS, hostArch := env["GOHOSTOS"], env["GOHOSTARCH"]

345:   gomodcache := env["GOMODCACHE"]

346:

347:    log.Printf("GOOS=%v GOARCH=%v go instal

```

And, I don't see a similar code in the linked url (which is http, and is not desirable to click :-)

I also noticed Gemini Code Assist -Citation output channel has various random citation reports for code I "never generated nor accepted" :-)

```



2024-06-13 10:40:40: Accepted generated code with cited text

The diagostics will go away if I close this unnamed doc the Gemini extension creates, or choose the quick fix,

but I feel that seeing this random citation diagnostics on my own code is very strange.

> Hello all, I have a question about billing of Gemini Code Assist usage without subscriptions. I have a customer who appears to have up to 30 users using code assist and in late may they started getting billed for them. I know we were allowing 1 free trial license per billing account officially but when they weren't prevented from using it with more than one, it appears they kept letting more users access it. They started getting billed (appears to be the $19/month rate from BHI billing data) but nowhere on the docs I've seen does it say that usage will be billed without a subscription.

1. is this normal (billed without signing up for a subscription) or did someone enable the servie behind the manager's back at the customer?

2. is that our plan officially to bill for usage until we have the tools to limit use without subscriptions in July?

3. is aly of this documented somewhere internally or externally so I can review myself? I haven't found this described anywhere yet.

If the question is yes, do they need to restrict 30 specific accounts for this?Hello Hope to learn if any PM here. Customer is planning to purchase Code assist but needs to understand the pricing model. We opened a ticket here: https://metabug.corp.google.com/entity/151955539?audience=40

Here is their question.

Assuming there are 100 people in their group. However, only 30 people are developers who require this code assist license. Do they purchase only 30 people subscription? If the question is yes, do they need to restrict 30 specific accounts for this?

> Hi team, My customer is looking into code assist but would like to setup an ''experiment'' to compare using code assist to no tool and to tabnine. (So they would have 3 groups). Did anyone work on something similar? Which metrics would you advice they track for this? How can they make the groups comparable? Ideally it should not be on similar tasks so that they don't slow down their teams.

> Ya'll, we've gotta stop talking about languages being not/supported in a binary way. Gemini models are trained on both public and private data. Consequently, Gemini can produce responses for any coding language represented in the public domain – from the common (e.g. JavaScript) to the specialized (e.g. Julia). When working with AI, however, the question of support cannot merely be answered with a binary "yes or no." Instead, support is measured by degrees of quality. In general, response quality improves with the quantity and diversity of training data available. Google has chosen validate quality for 22 of the most popular coding languages, and 38 natural languages (source).

In GA we plan to introduce code transformation Commands such as /fix /docs /optimize (/generate is already available in preview on vSC ide btw). Hope this helps and feel free to reach out if you have further Qs

Triggering aside, one can notice that a command prefixed with "/generate" will generate code and show it in a "Gemini Diff", however further changes of the code must be done in the Chat Window and the Transform functionality stops here.

I've checked the settings and the 'DuetAI:Project' is set correctly for the 'User', but not the 'Workspace'.

I even went into the workspace setting for 'DuetAI:Project' and set it to the project where the API is enabled, so no success.

If I had to speculate, I'd say that one reason the model isn't consistent about how it handles language is that all of our prompt engineering, preambles, system instructions etc are all in English. So the model sees a mix of english and portuguese and doesn't always pick the right one to respond in.

Does it help if the chat instruction includes a phrase along the lines of "please respond only in portuguese"? ("por favor responda somente em português")

We onboarded the developers (Mobile dev, QA team)

They reported us on slow 10s+ response time, which they consider it is too slow.

Example prompts:

- Can you create testcase base on UI design?

Any suggestions on how to further checks.

This is quite annoying for the customer . Can we somehow disable the Gemini integration in

the Billing Report overview for customer project or prevent the error message from showing every

time they click on something?

Checking logs for them I can see message: "PERMISSION_DENIED" method: "google.cloud.cloudaicompanion.v1.EntitlementService.CheckStatus" service: "cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com"

Found few bugs b/339286598 related to this RUR policy and EntitlementService.CheckStatus calls.

Is there a way to prevent this errors for customer or disabling the gemini for them (considering they dont want to use it) or exempt their project for this checkstatus calls?

Are non-code files (like documentation) supported?

The indexer is based on semantic indexing, meaning that it only supports code files in the <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ME2m-ynCnFuPFyQwR-048KHlfcPXRjkV0OagHewFgQQ/edit?resourcekey=0-CVZeqlb8x0gYFhiNsvfGIA&tab=t.0#heading=h.dug9ochwvku7|currently supported languages>.

Support for freeform documentation files is a frequent customer request and will likely be supported in a future release.

Over the last few months, we've been steadily making investment and improvements in the area of *Code Assist metrics*. Among the most demanded requests has been guidance that can help answer: "How should I assist our customers with conducting an evaluation? What should be measured, how, and why?".



To answer these questions, we recently prepared a *Code Assist - Evaluation metrics toolkit*. In this toolkit we provide a conceptual framework, references to quantitative and qualitative measures, and high-level guidance for conducting an evaluation. You can find the toolkit, here: go/codeassist-metrics-toolkit



*We're also roadshowing this toolkit *for those interested in hearing firsthand what it is and how to apply it. We intend to cover Code Assist *metrics features and roadmap *as well.

I have the latest version of the extension (released earlier today).

This problem has been going on for several weeks intermittently.

One minute it works fine, the next minute, the spinner starts spinning and I get the message about Gemini is working... which never goes away. I have to disable the extension and re-enable it.

I currently have a customer with Trial and they mainly use Bitbucket Cloud

(vector https://vector.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/006Kf00000J9AKsIAN/view )



Thank you very much.

The customer is very hard. It took me 6 months to close the 2 year deal. And there is a lot of expectation on the roadmap of the product.

So, telling them about one year access will create a problem for us.

And we just signed a 3-year renewal to their commitment. So, I really like the offering of one year, but it does not solve the problem.



So, my ask is to extend the offering for the contrat length.

How can we do that?

Their GitLab server is configured to only allow access from specific IP addresses for security reasons. Therefore, they need to ensure that the IP address used by Developer Connect to connect to their GitLab server is a static IP address.

And the running costs of an index are not far off from the cost of 10 enterprise seats.

(1) Will the traffic routing happen via open internet or this will go via our GCP landing zone?

(2) Will Gemini code assist point to a specific LLM trained for purpose or this will be pointed to the generic Gemini LLM? ```

I believe #1 private traffic from on-prem to cloud over interconnect is possible via private Google APIs.

For a simple code change, they are getting 6 code completion logs for 3 requests. 1 empty request and 2 health checks. One of the heath check responses is of the form:

```

My customer is using Code Assist enterprise.

Do you know how to extend my access to Gemini Code Assist for PEEPs genai? go/peeps-vscode-ai#step-1-register-peeps-code-ai-users-membership

The Sphinx UI doesn't allow me to extend it: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/34VfcnZy5bHxQXm.

Also I cannot do it from Ganpati UI either.

If I check my current status, it's shown as Revoked: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/7PHLkL3P4iiYFhr

I contacted `peeps-code-ai-users+owners@google.com` yesterday. But I haven't heard back yet.

If I open couple of files in IDE, then it's only able to remember those files and sends as a context (that I can see in the Terminal Output tab). As you can imagine for it to be able to generate any meaningful code of my local repo, it would need to understand all the Classes (the one's I have never opened in the IDE too).

I know this was a limitation a few months back with DuetAI, but thought it was solved with "local code awareness"

Any hints - what am I doing wrong ?

My security Cx is looking to mitigate risk of vulnerabilities in their legacy code, primarily C and C++, with high branching_factor and technical debt. Key questions about Code Assist:

- Visual Studio Editor integration is an important ask? Is it in the roadmap

- Any performance benchmarks for Code assist in C/C++ system code generation? (Especially with complex codebases)

- Can it generate automated test cases to improve code reachability? Currently reachability is in the ballpark of 70-80%

- Can it generate comments that go beyond basic API descriptions (like javadoc / docstring) and , providing insightful explanations of complex code logic and algorithms?

- _How can it (or any other solution) assist with large-scale code migration/upgrades? (Similar to Amazon's AI-assisted code transformation)_

- Does Code Assist use a "semantic engine" alongside Gemini? (Think Wolfram Engine + LLM)

- Does it use the same Gemini 1.5 model as the chatbot?

Essentially, they need a solution that not only helps developers write new code faster, but also improves code quality, reduces risk, and aids in modernizing their legacy systems. Github Copilot and Gitlab Duo are other solutions being evaluated.

for example, what will billing look like if a customer signs up on December 6, from a customer (external) and account (internal) perspective? i.e. how is that revenue/spend reported in plx/bhi? It looks the $ amount is prorated but appreciate any clarity on this. Thanks in advance!

As Gemini Code Assist is not available via SDK/API (yet), we are generating the unittests with custom prompts + Gemini.

In September, we launched code customization which enables RAG for remote repositories, supporting code generation and code completion. Now we are adding support for Chat!

*Customers can now use natural language to interact with remote repositories.* Simply ask questions about your indexed remote repositories through chat prompts.

*

Imagine this scenario*

Assuming that _*foo*_ is a function defined in Repository A, _*bar* _is a function defined in Repository B, and *_baz_* is a function you're writing locally, you can now use natural language to chat with your repositories:

* *Example 1: Understanding Remote Functions* "Tell me about function _*foo*_ (located in the remote repository). What does it do? Would it be appropriate to use _*foo*_ in my code?"

* *Example 2: Generating Code with Cross-Repository Awareness* "Give me 3 options for defining _*baz*_, potentially based on _*foo*_ and *_bar_*."



This feature is currently in an *experimental* phase, and we're eager for your feedback to help us shape its future.

If you or your customer are interested in trying out code customization with chat, *<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfa8Vbf08oGO-bw2L5ZNeSUaj-YTQSqGnV8MmoUxMgq-UYUwQ/viewform?usp=header|sign up for the experiment using this form>*.

Gemini Code Assist tools are a paradigm shift in how developers get the information they need to build and manage apps. By integrating popular developer technologies (starting with Atlassian Rovo, Github, Gitlab, Google Docs and Sentry) directly within the coding environment, this new tools feature can help eliminate the friction of context switching, enabling developers to write better code, fix bugs, review tasks more efficiently while reducing errors. 



We will be allowlisting and onboarding customers over the coming weeks.

Everyone,



As of today, we are *pausing our plans for Code Assist hard license enforcement*. No additional license enforcement will occur on January 27.



We've decided to prioritize active users over technical enforcement, based on customer conversations, assignment stats for purchased licenses, and overall usage mix. Any customer with usage beyond their current purchased capacity will be asked to increase their future purchase size but users will not be blocked. By making this change today, we are ensuring a good experience for end-user developers (both inside and outside of Google) as we reprioritize feature work for Next'25 and the coming launch of the unannounced Free Tier.



We will be sending an MSA with updated communication to customers. We may still choose to enable hard enforcement at some point in the future but no date has been chosen at this time. Further internal Q&A is available on <https://yaqs.corp.google.com/eng/t/gemini-code-assist|YAQS>, or you can reach out to me directly with questions.



Finally, I wish to extend my personal gratitude to the broader Code Assist team for helping us reach this point. Because of your efforts, we have the option to make a solid, data-driven decision and serve our customers well. Thank you!

A question about Gemini Code Assist.

Do we have some recommendations or best practices in order to improve the response of the model?

I had a meeting with a customer that is using the trial and comparing with autopilot and some comments was:



Generic responses

Lack of context

Lack of details in the responses



They are using Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ and GoLang



They are programming using Java and Go



Any recommendations on how to improve the responses and behaviour of the model would be really helpful.



Thanks.

In my experience, if you chat with Code Assist in a language, it will *usually* respond in that language. That's just my own limited anecodatal experience. I don't think we have any guarantees.

My suspicion is that they will *probably* get better results with English prompts, since that has the majority of training and also our system instructions are all in English.

(2) Find the response log (inference response)

(3) Find the corresponding metadatalog codeExposure/chatResponse events using the originalRequestId field

(4) Compare the timestamps of all 3



#3 requires the metadatalog support, which will hopefully launch within the next week or so (my apologies Murriel, thank you for sending me the customer details - I will respond to your IM by EOD).

Just got out of a call with a potential customer for Code Assist Enterprise



I got a question about 2 things:

 - custom system prompts such as in vertex ai editor

 - git hooks pre-push that would trigger devai review feature to avoid pushing unreviewed code



You, Yesterday 5:09 PM, Edited

custom system prompts could be a list of entries in a file such as in `.aiexclude`

but instead labeled `.genericprompt` of some sorts



which can be given as a valuable instruction to standardize assumptions when generating code, such as in the examples below:

* this team is a a team of js devs and they are working in this react app, focus on the scope of this app for this team

* only generate secure code

* always generate comments

* ensure to provide lint-free code

* bla bla bla



as a potential customer pre requisite this can be then be versioned in SCM so that every dev uses the same system prompt, or create different files for different teams in a monorepo.



The git pre hooks would require access to the gemini binary which is in some docs/demos they saw, used to be `devai`but somehow renamed to `gemini`and is included in the plugin for github/gitlab demos.

First, make sure you have verbose logging enabled in your settings.json:



    "geminicodeassist.verboseLogging": true



There should be a lot of info in the Output panel, under "Gemini Code Assist" and/or "Gemini Code Assist Debug".



In addition, if you go to https://sherlog.corp.google.com/ and hit "enable tracing", there's a lot of useful data there. (If tracing is enabled, you should also see some Sherlog links appear in the output window logs)

However, after some time, the permission granted to my principal to make the purchase is revoked taking with it the permission to manage the licenses attribution.

That is not a big issue, since I configure the license attribution as automatic.

But the issue is: I need to showcase my customer how to manage it.

So, I'd need to get "<https://pantheon.corp.google.com/iam-admin/roles/details/roles%3Cconsumerprocurement.licensePoolEditor?authuser=2&chat=true&inv=1&invt=AbrvRQ&project=dev-ghack|Consumer Procurement License Pool Editor>" in my Argolis BA. And I didn't find a way to do that in cloud-environments.googleplex.com other than the same procedure in doc above wich revokes the permisssion after some time.

As the mentioned role doesn't allow for purchases, the ideal is to have it forever.

I have been using Code Review Agent in my customer sessions. Recently demo-ed it at PayPal and Wipro using Python code. It was received very well. However, I am not able to make the CR agent work with Java code.



The GCA bot reviewer is not getting added in GitHub. I am following the same steps as I follow with Python.

Is there an open bug on Java with CR agent?

The user could configure a profile which would include the persona e some additional fixed context.

For instance, this user needs to inform all the time they start a new chat, what is their persona, language, version and other "more fixed" context info.

Is there a way to easily toggle the Gemini Code Assist Code Customization feature on and off directly within the Cloud Shell Editor or Cloud Workstations interface?

Ideally, it would be great if this could be done simply through the Gemini Code Assist extension settings in the editors themselves, or perhaps via the Developer Connect page in the Google Cloud console.



Current workaround (?):

Based on the current documentation (https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/code-customization#turn-off-code-customization), it seems the primary method to disable customization involves deleting the index entirely.

Final Thoughts:



I'm now much more confident in this list of private variables. The additional context from the other files has been very valuable in refining my analysis. *While I still don't have the actual code, this is a highly probable representation of what you'd find in TransactionEventTrigger.scala.

Is there something on the GCA roadmap that covers the functionality Cline is offering today? and if yes, can I onboard the customer to the preview program? Thanks!

My customer has about 650 developers using simultaneously Code Assist to generate code, suggestions and comments.

Carrefour is worried that they may hit quota issues.

Code Assist'ers, we will keep this short. A few weeks ago we announced a handful of features that were available in dogfood (<https://chat.google.com/room/AAAALJmrcaY/JDhP0efqc0U/JDhP0efqc0U?cls=10|[Helpdesk] Gemini Code Assist - go/code-assist-faq for common questions>) .

These (_chat history and threads_, _structured chat edits_, and _rules_) are now available as GA. (VSC 2.32.0)

We've additionally launched _@folder support for IntelliJ_ as Preview. (IJ 1.14.0)

These features launched quickly, aiming to address near term customer requests and needs. Thank you all again for your ongoing support with dogfood, bug filing, and customer/market feedback.

However, with Jules reportedly launched at the Google I/O today and Gemini Code Assist Agents debuting at Google Next last month, is the FAQ's guidance still valid?

I would like to know if it would be through the console or via a new invoice.Hi All, Customers will purchase a one-month paid license via an Order Form. If they do not renew after this period, my understanding is that the license will not become unusable, but rather they will be able to continue using it at the list price. Is this correct?



If yes, how would an invoice be handled in that case? I would like to know if it would be through the console or via a new invoice.

This project uses angular, there are over 600 sub-directories under node_modules. It's sending all of that stuff up.   That seems like the wrong thing.



I have an .aiexclude file in my local directory, at the root.  It includes entries like this  (and more):

```.git/

.vscode/

# Node / Angular

**/node_modules/

**/dist/

````

...but when I ask a question, like "What can you tell me about this repository?" referencing the root directory, I See messages like the following in the output window:

I am not seeing any direct answers to the below questions that my customer wanted clarity on.

I checked the docs and the FAQ, but it's not fully clear.



* Since the licenses are user based, can one user use Gemini in multiple GCP projects and still have this covered under 1 license? _*(I assume yes)*_

*_

_** Is there any additional costs associated with using Gemini in GCP if the user has a license assigned to them? If so, is the billing against the project the prompt is ran in or against the Gemini license project? _*(I believe there is no additional cost, and it's based on the subscription)*_



* What happens if a user uses Gemini in a project and they do not have a license associated with them? _*(I believe they will be blocked by either IAM permissions or some 403 message due to access issues)*_



Any guidance here is appreciated, thanks.

They had raised a support case about this and in both cases, support could not provide a satisfactory solution. While for the first issue, the team mentioned that it was a UI thing which is being changed in future iterations, it's the second one that left me wondering.

GCA has no local codebase awareness, practically rendering the use-case infeasible.



The functionality within code customization is for indexing remote repositories that are located in the customers source control system.  Based on the customers prompt, code customization will take a look at the index code and pull in additional context to improve the quality of response that Gemini Code Assist is generating.



It appears the functionality the customer is looking for is automatic indexing of their local codebase, which they're trying to use code customization to achieve.  This is not the intended purpose of code customization and it won't give them the desired results.  This is not a feature that is currently supported in Gemini Code Assist, but they can use the '@' file operator to reference local files or folders that they want to pass in with the prompt (per the response from support).



That being said, we are making enhancements to our local codebase awareness support to provide functionality closer to what the customer is expecting.  Here's the bug that's currently tracking this work: <https://b.corp.google.com/421249695|b/421249695>

My customer tries agent mode(agent tab) of Android Studio with Gemini for Businesses and Enterprise License.

When the customer asked Gemini to create new file in agent mode, but Gemini couldn't create the file.

```I don't have direct access to browse your local file system or the specific files within the /product/app/src/androidTest/java/ directory. Therefore, I can't directly scan those files for missing imports.

````

The docs(https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features#agent-mode) says `The agent suggests edits and iteratively fixes bugs to reach the goal. You can review, accept, or reject the proposed changes`. So I think this is "Work as Intended".

I have three questions about GiAS's Agent mode.

Q1. Is my above understanding that current GiAS's Agent mode cannot write to local files correct?

Q2. Is Android Studio's Agent mode different from private preview SLDC(kanban board) agent?

Q3. I saw b/418011199. Is this agent mode(agent tab) originally available for Gemini for Individuals(free tier), not Businesses? I'd like to know the current status of this agent mode.

Thank you in advance.

A customer is having trouble with DevConnect .

I don't have complete information accessible here, ... But…

They are seeing errors in the logs with secret manager. Specifically on the CreateSecret method.

The path to the secret looks normal, up to the secret id which is "invalid secret id" (with the spaces). That appears in the resource path. And the error message says (I'm copying this from my phone, which is where I see the message from the customer). . ..

The provided Secret ID [invalid secret id] does not match the expected format [[a-zA-Z0-9]+]

the resourceName is projects/502431591079/secrets/invalid secret id

What would cause Dev Connect to generate that, any idea?

I'm guessing there was another failure earlier in the process. The customer is saying there are no errors previous to that one.

secretmanager service is available; since we're getting a bonafide error message, not a message like "Service is not enabled on this project". And the customer confirmed that manually.

Any ideas?

Can you please add a command line argument that allows adding verbatim gn command line additional arguments to the command line of the @file scripts/build_python.sh script, so that users can add additional configurations beyond the already-included overrides for things like chip_detail_logging. _Note that I am a part of the CHIP Project Authors group, and I am the licensed owner of the file according to the Apache License_.

This has worked to unblock a lot of usecases since the contributors are actually the owners of the file. If file owners get warnings about licensed code that relates to their license, this could be attempted, depending on the context.

`LogEntry.jsonPayload`

Some concerns:

* At times the chat is quite slow (e.g., 30-60 second waiting time for response), it would be great if we could figure out how to fix this.

* Daily login is a bit of a hassle for users. This seems to vary for different users.



Feature Requests:

* There is a strong interest in using the existing Gemini licenses in Firebase, but they have different Google Cloud projects. Is there a possibility to get it to work with one project for Gemini and another for the actual project being worked on?

* Agent Mode to analyze and work across multiple files.

* Ability to use custom instructions and saved prompt files.

Who should I talk to about CI/CD use cases using Code Assist? They have seen all the coding demos and don't see an obvious advantage to moving to Gemini.

They're looking for a reason to use us in their enterprise -- IDE plugins aren't going to do it.

The customer is curious about Google, so they're asking us -- "Can Gemini help me with my CI/CD pipeline? What compelling argument does Google have for using them in this environment?"

They are already using Amazon Q, and unless we offer them something interesting (that Amazon/GitLab can't do) they will just continue using Amazon/GitLab.

They've seen the basic Code Assist demo, and the reaction was "it's not that different than what we have".

*Indexing Side*



* We use a library treesitter to make code chunks.

* We run unixcoder embedding model, to embed this chunks and store in Vector (i.e. Alloy) DB



*Retrieval*



* We run unixcoder embedding model, to convert user input (i.e. code or natural language) into embeddings using unixcoder.

* Then we pass this embeddings to ALloyDB which will find the relevant snippets.

* This snippets are added to context being passed to LLM.

* Then finally o/p from LLM is returned to user.



Lemme know if you want to know more.

IMO, we are better off taking a flanking strategy here, and not competing directly with GitHub Copilot.

Devs ❤️for <customEmojis/:github:>, Copilot's first mover advantage and <customEmojis/:github:> 's perceived cloud neutral posture are <customEmojis/:github:>'s inherent strengths.

CTO/CEO's natural tendency is to associate GCA with GCP, and it's ideal for us to start there.

GCA's sweet spots for a CTO/ CEO who have significant investments in the Google/ GCP ecosystem, are it's exclusivity on GCP & Google owned surfaces - BigQuery, Android Studio, Firebase + the popular IDEs.

Instead of going head-on, if it's feasible to get their specific segments of their practitioners, such as... Android Devs(on Android Studio), Data Scientists (on BQ/ Collab), and GCP DevOps folks (on GCP Console) + devs deploying to GCP I feel we have an edge.

I understand this reduces our TAM, but keeps us in the play and in our areas of strengths!

In the VSCode extension, I can choose a GCP project to use with GCA.



How does the Gemini CLI find the right project to use for RAG?

> So we talk about limits in the public blog post (60 requests per minute, 1,000 requests a day) for free (for personal use Google ToS, not Cloud ToS).  Question... if I use Gemini Code Assist Standard (~$20/pupm) in agent mode, are there any limits to requests / tokens per minute? Does this go through Vertex behind the scenes, will they see usage in Vertex or is this going to a shared, multi-tenant instance of the Gemini API? Do we have an FAQ on agent mode?

If `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` <https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/configuration.md|is set>, `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` is false, and a Code Assist license is active, can Claude code utilize GCA license quotas through `gemini-cli`?

*tl;dr: is there a way to delay inline suggestions from GCA (in VS Code)?*



Longer version.. no, first, I have been absolutely loving GCA.  While I totally get AI agents that live outside the IDE (including just talking to the Gemini app about code), I tried but totally didn't understand Cursor/Windsurf/Copilot, they all were just annoyances that didn't justify the hassle for me.  My Google bias aside, GCA is the first time I "got" having AI in my IDE.

_> Do we have a SKU for NotebookLM and Gemini Code Assist? _



Currently, there is no single SKU that combines NotebookLM and Gemini Code Assist.

Gemini Code Assist is a bundled offering primarily focused on providing AI-powered code assistance within various IDEs and Google Cloud products. While Gemini Code Assist offers basic integrations with some Google products like Colab Enterprise, BigQuery, and Firebase, NotebookLM is generally considered a separate offering.



_> How to quickly enable GCA in their NotebookLM instance?_

There is currently no option  to directly enable Gemini Code Assist within a NotebookLM instance as a seamless integration.

Gemini Code Assist functions as extensions within supported IDEs such as VS Code, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand), Cloud Workstations, and Cloud Shell Editor. Its integration with other Google Cloud services is typically at the product level (e.g., Gemini in BigQuery, Gemini in Apigee, Gemini in Databases).

Anyone here has the same problem?



I'm not able to test it because I don't have an Azure Devops Organization.



Here's the config they are following:



```{

    "mcpServers": {

        "mcp-server-time": {

            "command": "python",

            "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_time", "--local-timezone=America/Mexico_City"]

                "@azure-devops/mcp",

                "customerOrg"

            ]

        }

    }

}

````

They have some other MCP Server configured the same way and running without any problem.

Maybe you can sees something I don't.

The customer reporting a problem with the Gemini CLI agent appearing to switch to Gemini-2.5-flash after a few minutes of use. This has resulted in incorrect code edits that required the customer to revert to a previous git commit several times.

Is this a known issue? What suggestions can we provide to the customer to prevent this model-switching issue to optimize their experience? Thank you.

- We can’t find the RAG infrastructure endpoint. This means that RAG infra is not set up properly, but we don’t know what exactly.

- RAG is set up properly, but we didn’t find any relevant remote context. This can mean that RAG infra is set up properly, but:

TL,DR it just does not respect the project I have defined for it in the settings anymore.

For several days now, my "Accept changes" and "Accept all changes" button doesn't do anything. I tried to click on the "Send feedback" button and only see this error pops up:



"Cannot create a string longer than 0x1fffffe8 characters"



Is there any info I can collect to help debug this?

Both of these extensions have project settings.  Correct me if I'm wrong but:

*

**Cloud Code Project* - sets the project used when working with cloud resources like Cloud Run, GKE, ...



*Gemini Code Assist Project* - sets where the code assist APIs must be enabled and the user assigned the correct IAM permissions.



*The question is the relationship between the Gemini Code Assist Project and the project used to grant the user a Gemini Code Assist Subscription.*



For example, assume the customer manages subscriptions to GCA in project A.  If they enable the GCA APIs in Project B, so that its the same as the one configured for the Cloud Code Project, does this make use of the subscription that was provisioned and assigned to Project A.



Our documentation really isn't clear about this and the fact that the console shows the subscriptions within the context of a specific project makes things a bit confusing.

I have a customer that has an order form on its table to subscribe to code assist

but they have an active PAYG subscription from another entity under the same billing account.



i'm wondering if this is still true :



*Q1: What is an important consideration to understand about Gemini Code Assist subscriptions?*

An important aspect of the current commercial framework is that a customer can have only one active subscription per billing account. We recognize this architectural limitation can create challenges for customers, especially larger organizations, and may require workarounds.

Some consequences of this include:

* Customers cannot have both monthly and annual subscriptions on the same billing account. This impacts those who may want a mix of licenses for full-time and temporary staff.

* An offline (CPQ) subscription cannot be added if a self-service one already exists on the billing account. The current solution is to use a separate billing account.

* Changing from a monthly to an annual plan involves canceling the current subscription and purchasing a new one.

* If a customer has a self-service trial on a billing account, it may block a larger offline (CPQ) order. In this case, support will need to manually cancel the trial before the paid subscription can be set up.

Our teams are aware of these challenges and the friction they can cause during procurement and expansion. While there is no committed ETA for a fix, we are aware of the need for a more flexible infrastructure for SaaS license management.



if that's the case, we need to create a new billing account before getting their signature, any idea ?

We would like to elicit your feedback for a feature decision we are making. To participate, all you need to do is click the 1️⃣ or 2️⃣ below.



*Feature*: We are adding the ability to recall chat prompts using the up and down arrow keys in the chat input. This will allow you to quickly find and utilize/edit prior prompts. There are two ways we can implement this:



1️⃣ - *Current chat thread only*. We limit the prompts to the current chat thread only. As you scroll up and down, you will only see the prompts from your active chat thread (and not others).

2️⃣ - *All chat threads*. The recalled prompts are from across all chat threads. Here, you may see prompts from other chat threads as you up/down arrow keys.



In discussion, there are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches - but *we want to hear from YOU* about which you would prefer.



*Action*: Please click the 1️⃣ or 2️⃣ below with your preference vote by 12noon EST Wed Jul 23 2025. Your input will be used to make a final decision (and hopefully launch soon!)



Thank you!

> My personal reason for at least having access to "all" in some way (even though up/down arrow itself may not be quite the right way) --> when a chat becomes too "stuck" or "biased" due to prior context, and you are incrementally doing more work, you may want to get a new chat context to avoid the LLM from "sticking to the past" which happens quite strongly when you get to a certain point of numbers of incremental prompts. So getting access to the whole history easier I guess is the point. Up/down working across chats may cause the proverbial "streams to cross" if not done carefully enough. I often have 2 projects on the go, each with separate chats. In Gemini web right now, it's quite hard to figure-out the histories if you stick to auto-naming of chats.

At the moment paid customers receive 250 Pro requests per day, while free tier users receive 50 Pro requests per day.



In the next two weeks, we're looking to double Pro quota to 500 requests per day for paid customers.

"Agent Error, unknown agent message: [{ "error": { "code": 429, "message": "Quota exceeded for quota metric 'Gemini 2.5 Pro Requests' and limit 'Gemini 2.5 Pro Requests per day per user per tier' of service '<http://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/|cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com>' for consumer 'project_number:###'.", "errors": [ { "message": "Quota exceeded for quota metric 'Gemini 2.5 Pro Requests' and limit 'Gemini 2.5 Pro Requests per day per user per tier' of service '<http://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/|cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com>' for consumer 'project_number:##'.", "domain": "global", "reason": "rateLimitExceeded" } ], "status": "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED" } }"



Is this purely quota & limit issue or insiders channel? I thought the limits & quota daily constraints that automatically reset the next day.

Any ideas what the problem or the potential solution might be?

For staging project (`jhanvi-staging)`I see when logging is enabled at project level, the events are not getting logged because the I think the default calue of `log_prompts_and_responses` and `log_metadata` is false, even after enabling logging its not setting to true for staging.  Sherlog: http://sherlog/_kiM9D2q6hy



The vscode `settings.json` looks like:



{

    "cloudcode.duetAI.cloudCodeQuotaProject": "aipp-internal-testing",

    "cloudcode.duetAI.cloudCodeEndpoint": "https://staging-cloudcode-pa.sandbox.googleapis.com/",

}



Is there any way this values can be set to True and entries are logged in staging?

The reason I use the monorepo is it uses srcfs and turning on scans and notifications on such a large code base with virtual fs has a large impact on performance so I've been tuning to that.  This is all controlled by local codebase awareness so turning this off would help indicate this as a possible cause.Something that would be good to know is if turning off local codebase awareness has an effect on the performance issue.

Does the CPU spike and then return to normal or does it stay consistent?

I'm experimenting Code Assist with Enterprise license in Agrolis, using google.geminicodeassist in VS Code (2.42.0).

Any chat query asking for Gemini above 1.5 seems to fall back to 1.5 and Gemini telling me it's the latest model.

I realize there are cutoffs to model trainings, but is this expected behaviour, or when we could expect chat to be able to talk to using 2.5? Thanks 🙂

> Can you create a python app that will pass query from command line to Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM on Vertex as a prompt?

< Of course! I can certainly help you create a Python application to query the Gemini 1.5 Flash model on Vertex AI from your command line.
